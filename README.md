## Welcome to Shuffle!
This project was born from an idea I had about how swaping html elements' positions could be possible.

### What was it like to build it?

I decided to implement it using position absolute/relative and apply classes with top and left values based on the components position in an array.

Writing the algorithm to swap was fairly simple, just remove and element from the front and add it to the beginning or vice versa.

There was a bug where gatsby wasn't building propertly when I passed the SVGs as props, so I had to import them into the child component to work around that.

All in all, it was a fun project. I hope you get a kick out of it!
